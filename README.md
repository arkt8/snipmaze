# SnipMaze

_Because git gists are very disperse..._

Some little treasures I found or I fast sketched to some specific
use but that can have further and bigger use in other projects.

Also a notebook to answer who needs with the best open source
spirit.

The organization structure is per specific context of use or
language.

If a code is for Lua, is in the Lua folder... but if it is in
Lua but specific for NeoVim, so it is in the NeoVim instead.

Enjoy!
